        <h3>Coordination System:</h3>
        <p>Academic coordination is pivotal to our education system. The coordinators and facilitators ensure:</p>
        <p>The coordinators play the role of a friend, partner, guide, mentor and a counselor. The coordinators cater to the professional development of the teachers as well. In the weekly meetings, they gradually develop the professional competence of the teachers.</p>
        <p>To instill Islamic values in the children, co-curricular activities such as Morning Assemblies, Debates and Sports are regularly organized.</p>
        <p>In the higher classes, Fehm-ul-Quran and Hadith are stressed upon. Islamic history and Fiqh are also introduced in the Islamiat syllabus. Topics are carefully selected to build a sound moral foundation and to contribute towards strong character building of the students.</p><br><br><br><br>
